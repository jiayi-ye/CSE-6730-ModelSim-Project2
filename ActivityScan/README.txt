This folder provides simulation using activity scanning.
Lane.py: create lane object
TrafficLight.py: create traffic lights
Vehicle.py: create cars
Vars.py: set the car arrival distribution and simulation time
ActivityScan.py: one simulation of cars running from 14th to 10th and return the average time
Simulate.py: call one_simulation once and 100 times to see average time distribution. Plots will be generated

Running the  using command: python Simulate.py can get the result: average running time of cars of within one simulation and of 100 simulations
